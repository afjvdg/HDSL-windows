/// Verifies that an archive cannot name an entry that lands outside what is being unpacked.
///
/// An extractor walks the tree this class builds and writes each name under the directory it is
/// unpacking into, so a name is a **path**, and a path is what an archive chooses for itself. What
/// made this a defect is the platform difference: `..\\..\\Startup\\x.bat` carries no `/` at all, so
/// it was one "file name" to the split — and three directories to the Windows path parser the
/// extractor then handed it to. The same archive is inert on Linux and macOS, which is why nothing
/// caught it.
///
/// The names below are the shapes that reach the platform's parser as more than a name. A malformed
/// archive is not an error anywhere: the entry is left out and the rest of the archive still
/// unpacks, which is what the valid entry in each case is here to pin.
